                        I majored in Physics and minored in Computer Science at the University of Illinois
                        at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

                        <br />
                        College was a transformative experience for me, where I
                        discovered many passions, one of which is writing clean, modular, and performant code.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Over time, I've garnered skills in Linux/Unix administration, 
                        .NET, Java, and Python development, Cloud Computing, and Data Warehousing.
                        I continue push myself to learn about emergent tools and technologies every day!

                        <br />
                        In my free time, I pursue my artistic passions, namely, music, creative writing, and 
                        photography.
